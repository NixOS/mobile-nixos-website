This update is the eighth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.


=== Notable changes

Most of the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-06+sort%3Acreated-asc[
9 pull requests merged] were trivial or minor changes. Though there's
still some notable changes.

==== Pinephone bluetooth support

It turns out all it needed was a trivial fix. link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/163[
Giving it the firmware it wanted] adds proper support for bluetooth on the
Pinephone.

If you are using the `examples/demo` rootfs, its configuration does not
currently configure the system for audio with bluetooth. The instructions to
configure audio for bluetooth link:https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Bluetooth#Using_Bluetooth_headsets_with_PulseAudio[
are the same as usual], as Mobile NixOS is composed on top of NixOS.

==== Redmi Note 8 Pro

The port for link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/171[xiaomi-begonia]
is mainly notable for being the first port for a Mediatek SoC.

I am singling out this port as a proof that the link:https://samuel.dionne-riel.com/blog/2020/04/24/mobile-nixos-breadth-first-development.html[
breadth-first development] style is working well. Since Mobile NixOS had many
abstractions needed for the existing different platforms, this new platform,
and device, was ported without a sweat.

This also paves the way for other Mediatek ports by providing a working
example. Coupled with link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/175[#175],
another, older, Mediatek device (merged in early July), there is enough
material to give clues for future ports by community members.


=== New ports

One new device was merged this month.
