This update is the fourth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.

=== Notable changes

link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-02+merged%3A2020-03-01[3 PRs were merged]
during the month. This is not cheating, the last merged PR was merged late on
the 29th.

This is not development slowing down. Far from it. link:https://github.com/mobile-nixos/[Four new projects]
were added to the Mobile NixOS GitHub organization related to this month's
work. Keep on reading.

==== Graphical boot selection

Hot on the heels of the link:https://mobile.nixos.org/news/2020-02-04-january-2020-round-up.html[re-written init],
and as teased, a working graphical boot selection is now available for Mobile
NixOS platforms.

There is more than meets the eye in link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/80[pull request #80].

To make this possible, a GUI toolkit of relatively small weight has to be
found. After some research, it was found in the link:https://littlevgl.com/[LittlevGL]
library. While it is geared more towards _actual_ embedded development, it does
have a Linux framebuffer backend, support for evdev input. This is all standard
stuff that is well supported on all targets. What is really nice with that
library is it also supports a “simulator” target, which is basically an SDL
window. 

With that said, I personally don't want to write C, especially in complex use
cases. I already worked on mruby integration for the Mobile NixOS stage-1. It
was only natural to write link:https://github.com/mobile-nixos/mruby-lvgui[mruby bindings for LittleVGL].

With all the exposition done. What does this look like? The header image of
this news post is composed of four devices running the GUI. An actual
screenshot of the GUI follows, for better clarity.

This is not a feature complete generic replacement for a bootloader. Though, it
can become one when kexec support is added in the future.

Additionally, as touched upon in the pull request, these bindings will allow us
to improve the graphical boot process. In a future improvement we'll be able to
add information about the current running step, and better failure state
reporting.


=== Ports

No new port were made in February. There is still a 
link:https://mobile.nixos.org/devices/index.html[total of 10 devices] you can
build for.
