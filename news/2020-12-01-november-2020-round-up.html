<p>This update is the twelfth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There&#8217;s always <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls">more work</a>
currently in-progress.</p>

<h3 id="_notable_changes">Notable changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the month <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-11+sort%3Acreated-asc">
13 pull requests were  merged</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some major improvements landed, let&#8217;s take a peek.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_progress_in_stage_1">Progress in stage-1</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The boot splash utility <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/233">
now shows the progress of the boot</a>. This is done with a simple progress bar
shows how much of the tasks have been handled. Long-running tasks can provide
a message to show so the user knows things aren&#8217;t necessarily hung.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speaking of hung tasks. Our <code>init</code> <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/236">
now detects when no tasks resolved in a given amount of time</a>. When this
happens, the boot is being failed with, hopefully enough context in the error
message to help the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speaking of error messages. <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/239">
Error messages are now less of a dead-end for our users</a>. The interface has
been reviewed to put the text message front and center. Previously we were
showing a big image because we didn&#8217;t even have text rendering at this state.
Now that we do, let&#8217;s use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to that, the error applet is now somewhat interactive. There is
now a cancellable countdown; when the time is elapsed the kernel is crashed,
which allows the platform to do its default action (generally reboot). When
canceled, the user can select different options, either through the touch
screen, using a mouse, a keyboard or using volume-keys navigation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user can select to power off their device, which default action (so mashing
the power key will power off the device). Depending on whether the platform
supports it, the usual different reboot options are given.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_encrypted_root_filesystem_support">Encrypted root filesystem support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thought we were done with <em>stage-1</em> updates? No! What if it <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/234">
was now able to decrypt LUKS encrypted filesystems</a>? Well it can! For now,
this is mainly the <em>plumbing</em> to make it all work. Getting a LUKS encrypted
filesystem on your device is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our <em>stage-1</em> can now ask for a passphrase during the early boot process phases.
This is done through an on-screen keyboard. For the time being the keyboard is
hard-coded to be the US QWERTY layout, and this is bad. Further improvements
are planned, but out of scope for releasing the feature. The on-screen keyboard
will be necessary for other upcoming planned features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While using an on-screen keyboard is useful when you don&#8217;t have a physical
keyboard, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/242">physical
keyboards also can be used with that interface</a>. Similarly to the previous
note, it is hardcoded to be the US QWERTY keyboard, but the tooling chosen to
drive the keyboard mapping (libxkbcommon) will give us the ability to configure
<strong>both</strong> the on-screen and physical keyboard.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ports">Ports</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No new ports were made in November. There is still a <a href="https://mobile.nixos.org/devices/index.html">total of 15 devices</a> you can build for.</p>
