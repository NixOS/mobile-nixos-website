<p>This past October, on the 25th, a talk about Mobile NixOS was held at NixCon
2019, in Brno, Czechia. The talk was recorded and is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=229PpjZZouw">on the NixCon YouTube page</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bringing us to the next point: this new and shiny website. This is was described
as the next step for the project. This website is built by blurring the
difference between the documentation of the project and the website. This means
that, hopefully, neither the website or the documentation will lag behind in
relevance. Additionally, building the site and contributing should be as simple
as contributing to the documentation. Hopefully simple enough.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last, but not least, a few notes about the Hackday at the 2019 NixCon. I was
left with approximately no time to work on things myself, but instead was found
surrounded by bright individuals contributing neat stuff to the project.
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+created%3A2019-10-28+created%3A2019-10-27+created%3A2019-10-26">Those pull requests</a> are a good sample of what was done,
though early work on the OnePlus 5 was not advanced enough to be contributed back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wrapping this all nicely, I found that the main issue contributors around me had
was the lack of documentation about the porting process. I knew it was an issue,
hopefully this new website and progressing documentation helps.</p>
